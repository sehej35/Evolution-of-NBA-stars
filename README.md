# SQL-portfolio-project

### Project Name
Evolution between NBA Player's Relationship with Offense and Defense


### Project Objective
   a. The problem that I plan to solve would be data integration. The job position requires integrating data from multiple sources, which can be a challenge to accomplish given different data structures and formats. The objective behind wanting to solve this problem is due to the high importance of using SQL for ETL operations. One reason for this is efficiency. SQL provides a high-level, declarative language for processing data, making it easier and more efficient to extract, transform, and load large amounts of data. Another reason is SQL’s scalability. SQL is designed to handle large amounts of data, making it a scalable solution for ETL operations, even for organizations with very large data sets. Lastly, a reason is SQL’s flexibility. SQL provides a wide range of data manipulation and transformation capabilities, making it flexible enough to handle a variety of ETL scenarios, from simple data extracts to complex data integration projects.
   
   b. For the data integration challenge, I would use data integration tools and techniques such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to combine data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. I plan on using two main data sources as of now, which can change as I continue to explore and resolve these issues. The first data source would be relational databases, such as MySQL or Microsoft SQL server. The second data source would be flat files, such as CSV files or Excel. Some other data sources that may be integrated could be APIs and cloud based data sources. 


### Job Description
The job I chose is from a company called Sports Info Solutions (SIS). SIS was founded on the belief that decision making in sports could be improved and that they could help teams win more games through the use of better data, analytics, and technology.
The job title is "Basketball Research Associate". Within this job, SIS expects their associate to: Develop predictive models that scale and/or improve the insightfulness of our groundbreaking and rich dataset
, Maintain & enhance back-end data workflow, including the ingestion, automation, and analytics for in-house data collection

### Future Improvements
If I had more time, one thing I would do would be to add the datasets for the missing years between 2013 and 2022 in order to create a visualization in Tableau or Excel that demonstrates the evolution of high volume scorers and their net possession differential.
